 * Reorder an array according to given indexes
 * Last Updated : 04 May, 2025
 * Given two integer arrays of the same length, arr[] and index[], the task is to reorder the elements in arr[] such that after reordering, each element from arr[i] moves to the position index[i]. The new arrangement reflects the values being placed at their target indices, as described by index[] array.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [10, 11, 12], index[] = [1, 0, 2]
 * Output: 11 10 12
 * Explanation: 10 moves to position 1, 11 to 0, and 12 stays at 2.
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], index[] = [3, 2, 0, 1]
 * Output: 3 4 2 1
 * Explanation: 1 moves to 3, 2 to 2, 3 to 0, 4 to 1.
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [50, 40, 70, 60, 90], index[] = [3,  0,  4,  1,  2]
 * Output: 40 60 90 50 70
